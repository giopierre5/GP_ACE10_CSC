<p>Hey!</p>
My name is Giovanni. I was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up a small town called Woburn MA. I went to public schools up untill high school. I currently attend Phillips Academy Andover and absolutely <em>love<em> it here. For fun I like to play basketball, I row for my school's crew team, play video games, excersise, take photos, produce and listen to music, and lastlyâ€“watch an obscene amount of Netflix. My favorite movies are <em>Schindler's List, Scarface, Memento, The Matrix, and The Godfather series. Music is an  integral part of my life. I grew up listening to all kinds of music, ranging from hip-hop in the car with my dad to island music and RnB with my mom in the house. I listenn to rap, rock, reggae,soul, and RnB mainly. This website began as an asignment for my computer science class, but has now turned into a hub for all my work. Look at this as a way to see into my life. Here you'll find my other websites, projects, music I've made, writing, and my opinions on

  <p>No matter how much I may succed in life, my one goal is to be a role model to my little sister, Olivia. Whenever I'm stuck in a rut or in a bad place mentally, she gives me a hug and brightens up my day. I hope that she'll become a PA alum and set off on her own path with her own passions and aspirations. My favorite people in the world are my family (including my dog, Enzo!). I grew up in a immigrant household and could speak both English and Haitian Creole fluently for as long as I can remember. Languages are facinating to me and I'm working on being fluent in Spanish and French as well. My dad's a mechanic and my mom's a nurse practitioner. They sparked my intrest in both technology and medicine and I hope to combine the two into a future profession. My parents pushed me to do my best and were always supportive. They made sure that I did things because I wanted to, not because they wanted me to. My biggest inspiration in life is my mother. She is,to me, the most amazing person in the world. She came to the U.S. knowing no English, but herself through school with no help from her parents, and became the first college grad in her family. She had a bachelor's degree in buisness and gave birth to me. She preceeds to go back to school with an infant, became a nurse and worked at the best children's hospital in the country, maybe the world. Afer she had my sister, she returned back to school for a third time to become an NP. Because of her, I want to be a brain surgeon when I get older. So now that you know a little more about me, browse around, have fun, and feel free to email me with any feedback at giopierre5@gmail.com.
<p>Happy Surfing!</p> <p>~ Gio
